# ColorSplash

**Demo**: [ColorSplash](http://colors.carltonsegbefia.com/)

## What is it?
ColorSplash uses the [node-vibrant](https://github.com/akfish/node-vibrant/) library to extract colors from images and presents them in a simple and easy to use way. It gets images from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).  

## Why?
Deciding the colors to use for pictures is a surprisingly time consuming project.  ColorSplash aims to serve as a tool to generate beautiful color schemes based of images to speed up the process. 

## Who is this for?
Anyone who want’s to save time on design projects or wants a color scheme to go with a picture.

## Who made this?
My name is Carlton Segbefia. I’m a computer science and sociology major in Grinnell College with a love for design. ColorSplash was an idea that came to mind when I was working on a poster for a club event and after a few months of work between colors I completed it. Feel free to send any and all feedback to me@carltonsegbefia.com.

## Future Improvements?
Currently, ColorSplash uses a direct method of quantizing the images and extracting colors based on amount of representation. A better method would be to account for the ways humans perceive colors and how they look when put together. In other words, rather than focusing on accuracy, rather focus on how the colors look together, This can probably be done with a bit of machine learning.
